# Welcome to my eehiq analysis

This is a collection of resources that I used to study the new $e^+e^- \to e^+e^-$ samples
for the International Large Detector [ILD](https://www.ilcild.org)
at a $\sqrt{s}=250~GeV$ ILC machine.
The focus lies on their applicability to my
[Higgs Branching ratios study](https://github.com/LLR-ILD/EPS-HEP2021).

External resources that should be consulted:

- [ILD ELOG](https://ild.ngt.ndu.ac.jp/elog/genmeta/) for production information on the `2f_z_eehiq` sample.
- [My group meeting presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I_0eFcwR4OQmtmFVuAVHrtYE4Di9KM9OmeeXY8pRb4o/edit?usp=sharing) focuses more strongly on how the samples influences my Higgs analysis.
  - This book focuses on a single `2f_z_eehiq` file and analysis it thoroughly.
  - The presentation pushes all available `2f_z_eehiq` files through my analysis
    pipeline and looks at the consequences for this specific use case.
  - TODO: Contribute some of the presentation's main conclusions back to this book.

The book itself contains the following studies:
